# Seek guidance on TLS alternatives for MongoDB

## Domain: Compliance
**Context:** Sibling uses Node.js with TypeScript, Express.js, and MongoDB (Docker, port 27018) on Windows. We’re struggling with self-signed TLS certificate compatibility (DECODER routines::unsupported), leading to connection timeouts. Reverted to non-TLS for now.
**Details:** What are compliant alternatives for enabling TLS with MongoDB on Windows, considering GDPR/CCPA? Options like MongoDB’s built-in tools, Atlas-managed TLS, or third-party solutions, with setup complexity and cost implications?

## Response

### 1. MongoDB Built-in TLS with Let’s Encrypt

**Description:** Use MongoDB Community Edition’s TLS support with certificates from Let’s Encrypt instead of self-signed certs, avoiding compatibility issues.

**GDPR/CCPA Compliance:** Meets GDPR Art. 32(1)(a) and CCPA §1798.150 by encrypting data in transit with trusted certificates.

**Setup Complexity:** Moderate. Certbot on Windows (via WSL or Docker) generates certs; configure MongoDB with `--tlsMode requireTLS` and `--tlsCertificateKeyFile`. Requires domain ownership and renewal automation.

**Cost:** Free (Let’s Encrypt certs), minimal Docker overhead.

**Implementation Notes:** Run Certbot in Docker, mount certs to MongoDB container (e.g., `C:/mongo/certs:/data/certs`), update `docker-compose.yml` with TLS flags. Node.js client uses `mongodb` package with `tls: true, tlsCAFile`.

### 2. MongoDB Atlas Managed TLS

**Description:** Switch to MongoDB Atlas, a managed cloud service with built-in TLS, bypassing local certificate issues.

**GDPR/CCPA Compliance:** Compliant with GDPR Art. 32 and CCPA §1798.150 via automatic TLS and encrypted storage. Atlas includes compliance certifications.

**Setup Complexity:** Low. No local Docker TLS config needed; connect via Atlas URI with TLS enabled by default.

**Cost:** Free tier (M0: 512MB) for testing; M10+ (~$57/month) for production with full features.

**Implementation Notes:** Create Atlas cluster, get connection string (e.g., `mongodb+srv://`), update Express.js/Mongoose with `ssl: true`. No Windows-specific tweaks.

### 3. Third-Party Proxy: Nginx with TLS

**Description:** Run Nginx in Docker as a reverse proxy for MongoDB, handling TLS termination with a trusted certificate (e.g., Let’s Encrypt).

**GDPR/CCPA Compliance:** Secures data in transit (GDPR Art. 32, CCPA §1798.150) between app and proxy; MongoDB remains unencrypted internally.

**Setup Complexity:** High. Requires Nginx Docker setup, cert management, and proxy config. MongoDB stays non-TLS locally.

**Cost:** Free (Nginx + Let’s Encrypt), but increases resource use.

**Implementation Notes:** Add Nginx service to `docker-compose.yml`, map port 27018, use `ssl on` and cert paths in Nginx config. Node.js connects to Nginx port.

### Additional Considerations

**Current Issue:** The 'DECODER routines::unsupported' error likely stems from OpenSSL in MongoDB Docker rejecting self-signed cert formats (e.g., PEM encoding) or Windows OpenSSL version mismatches. Trusted CA certs (e.g., Let’s Encrypt) avoid this.

**Recommendation:** Start with MongoDB Built-in TLS with Let’s Encrypt for cost-free compliance and moderate setup. Atlas is ideal if budget allows and you prefer managed simplicity.
