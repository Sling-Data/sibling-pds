# Review and refactor Sibling codebase for best practices

## Domain: Engineering
**Sub-Context:** Sibling uses Node.js with TypeScript (backend), React with TypeScript (frontend), Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose in Docker, and Node.js crypto (AES-256-CBC). The codebase includes schemas (VolunteeredData, BehavioralData, ExternalData, User), API routes, React components (SignupForm, DataInput, Profile), and tests. Current file structure is in README.md.
**Deliverable:** A plan in JSON with identified best practice issues, refactoring subtasks, and assignment to frontend or backend agents.
**Notes:** Focus on maintainability, scalability, and alignment with TypeScript/React/MongoDB standards. Break into high-level subtasks for agent guidance, awaiting Tomé’s confirmation.

## Results

### 1. Backend - Route Logic

**Issue:** Potential duplication in encryption and validation logic across API endpoints

**Impact:** Harder to maintain and scale

### 2. Backend - Error Handling

**Issue:** Inconsistent or missing standardized error responses

**Impact:** Poor API reliability and debugging

### 3. Backend - Naming

**Issue:** Inconsistent schema file naming (e.g., user.model.ts vs. volunteeredData.model.ts)

**Impact:** Reduced readability

### 4. Frontend - Data Fetching

**Issue:** Repeated API fetch logic across components

**Impact:** Code duplication and maintenance overhead

### 5. Frontend - State Management

**Issue:** Reliance on App.tsx state without a scalable solution

**Impact:** Limits complexity as app grows

### 1. Modularize backend routes and logic

**Agent:** Backend

**Goal:** Create /routes and /controllers directories, move API logic into separate files

### 2. Standardize backend error handling

**Agent:** Backend

**Goal:** Implement a middleware for consistent error responses (e.g., JSON { status, message })

### 3. Rename schema files consistently

**Agent:** Backend

**Goal:** Standardize to UserModel.ts, VolunteeredDataModel.ts, etc.

### 4. Create a reusable data fetching hook

**Agent:** Frontend

**Goal:** Implement useFetch hook in /src/frontend/src/hooks for API calls

### 5. Introduce Context API for state

**Agent:** Frontend

**Goal:** Set up a UserContext in /src/frontend/src/context for app-wide state

### 6. Add tests for refactored code

**Agent:** Both

**Goal:** Update backend and frontend tests to cover new modules and hooks

### 7. Validate refactored codebase

**Agent:** Both

**Goal:** Run tests and manual checks to ensure functionality is preserved
