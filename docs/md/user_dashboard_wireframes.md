# Draft wireframes for user dashboard

## Domain: Design
**Sub-Context:** Sibling’s frontend is React. Users need a dashboard to see summaries of their volunteered, behavioral, and external data at a glance.
**Deliverable:** A JSON object with wireframe descriptions for a dashboard screen (sections: volunteered, behavioral, external; summary metrics; navigation to detailed views).
**Notes:** Keep it simple, text-based descriptions—no images yet. Consider how to display data from multiple schemas.
