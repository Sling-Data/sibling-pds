    "context": "Sibling uses Node.js with TypeScript, Express.js, and MongoDB (Docker, port 27018) on Windows. We’re struggling with self-signed TLS certificate compatibility (DECODER routines::unsupported), leading to connection timeouts. Reverted to non-TLS for now.",
    "details": "What are compliant alternatives for enabling TLS with MongoDB on Windows, considering GDPR/CCPA? Options like MongoDB’s built-in tools, Atlas-managed TLS, or third-party solutions, with setup complexity and cost implications?"

        "description": "Use MongoDB Community Edition’s TLS support with certificates from Let’s Encrypt instead of self-signed certs, avoiding compatibility issues.",
        "gdpr_ccpa_compliance": "Meets GDPR Art. 32(1)(a) and CCPA §1798.150 by encrypting data in transit with trusted certificates.",
        "setup_complexity": "Moderate. Certbot on Windows (via WSL or Docker) generates certs; configure MongoDB with `--tlsMode requireTLS` and `--tlsCertificateKeyFile`. Requires domain ownership and renewal automation.",
        "cost": "Free (Let’s Encrypt certs), minimal Docker overhead.",
        "implementation_notes": "Run Certbot in Docker, mount certs to MongoDB container (e.g., `C:/mongo/certs:/data/certs`), update `docker-compose.yml` with TLS flags. Node.js client uses `mongodb` package with `tls: true, tlsCAFile`."

        "setup_complexity": "Low. No local Docker TLS config needed; connect via Atlas URI with TLS enabled by default.",
        "cost": "Free tier (M0: 512MB) for testing; M10+ (~$57/month) for production with full features.",
        "implementation_notes": "Create Atlas cluster, get connection string (e.g., `mongodb+srv://`), update Express.js/Mongoose with `ssl: true`. No Windows-specific tweaks."

        "option": "Third-Party Proxy: Nginx with TLS",
        "description": "Run Nginx in Docker as a reverse proxy for MongoDB, handling TLS termination with a trusted certificate (e.g., Let’s Encrypt).",
        "gdpr_ccpa_compliance": "Secures data in transit (GDPR Art. 32, CCPA §1798.150) between app and proxy; MongoDB remains unencrypted internally.",
        "setup_complexity": "High. Requires Nginx Docker setup, cert management, and proxy config. MongoDB stays non-TLS locally.",
        "cost": "Free (Nginx + Let’s Encrypt), but increases resource use.",
        "implementation_notes": "Add Nginx service to `docker-compose.yml`, map port 27018, use `ssl on` and cert paths in Nginx config. Node.js connects to Nginx port."

    "additional_considerations": {
      "current_issue": "The 'DECODER routines::unsupported' error likely stems from OpenSSL in MongoDB Docker rejecting self-signed cert formats (e.g., PEM encoding) or Windows OpenSSL version mismatches. Trusted CA certs (e.g., Let’s Encrypt) avoid this.",
      "recommendation": "Start with MongoDB Built-in TLS with Let’s Encrypt for cost-free compliance and moderate setup. Atlas is ideal if budget allows and you prefer managed simplicity."
