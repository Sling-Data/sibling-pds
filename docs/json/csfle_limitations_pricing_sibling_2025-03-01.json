    "csfle_community_edition_limitations": [
      {
        "limitation": "No Automatic Encryption",
        "description": "Community Edition lacks the `mongocryptd` daemon required for automatic CSFLE, meaning encryption/decryption must be explicitly coded in the app (unlike Enterprise/Atlas). This increases complexity for TypeScript/Node.js developers.",
        "impact": "Requires manual encryption logic using `mongodb-client-encryption`, impacting simplicity but still GDPR/CCPA-compliant with proper key management."
      },
      {
        "limitation": "Limited Query Support",
        "description": "CSFLE in Community Edition doesn’t support complex queries (e.g., aggregations, $lookup) on encrypted fields due to server-side restrictions on encrypted BinData.",
        "impact": "May limit *Sibling*’s ability to perform advanced analytics on encrypted data, though basic equality searches are possible with deterministic encryption."
      },
      {
        "limitation": "No Built-in Key Management",
        "description": "Community Edition lacks native integration with Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP), requiring external solutions (e.g., AWS KMS) for secure key storage.",
        "impact": "Adds setup overhead in Docker but remains cost-free if using local key files or affordable KMS options."
      },
      {
        "limitation": "No Server-Side Schema Enforcement",
        "description": "Unlike Enterprise/Atlas, Community Edition can’t enforce encryption schemas at the database level, relying entirely on client-side logic.",
        "impact": "Increases risk of misconfiguration but manageable with robust TypeScript code reviews."

        "pricing": "Subscription-based, starts at ~$10,000/year for small deployments (varies by node count, support level). Contact MongoDB sales for exact quotes.",

        "pricing": "Pay-as-you-go, ~$0.012/hour ($9/month) for M2, scales with usage.",
        "pros": "Low entry cost, Docker-compatible, managed backups/security.",

        "pricing": "~$0.08/hour ($57/month) for M10, up to $100s/month for multi-region or large clusters.",
        "pros": "Best for compliance (GDPR/CCPA), zero Docker setup, scales easily.",
