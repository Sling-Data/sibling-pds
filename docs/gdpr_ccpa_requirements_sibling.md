# Outline basic GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements

## Domain: Compliance
**Sub-Context:** Sibling stores personal data in MongoDB. Users control access.
**Deliverable:** A JSON object listing 3-5 key requirements (e.g., encryption, consent) with descriptions and implementation notes.
**Notes:** Focus on data storage and user control.

## Results

### 1. Data Encryption

**Description:** Personal data must be encrypted at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access (GDPR Art. 32, CCPA §1798.150).

**Implementation:** Use MongoDB’s Encrypted Storage Engine (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.

### 2. User Consent

**Description:** Obtain explicit, informed consent from users before collecting or processing their personal data (GDPR Art. 6(1)(a), CCPA §1798.100).

**Implementation:** Implement a consent management system in Sibling’s UI, storing consent records in MongoDB with timestamps and user IDs.

### 3. Access Control

**Description:** Users must have granular control over who can access their data, including the ability to revoke access (GDPR Art. 15-17, CCPA §1798.105).

**Implementation:** Design MongoDB access policies with role-based access control (RBAC) and a user-managed permissions table.

### 4. Data Minimization

**Description:** Collect and store only the data necessary for the intended purpose, reducing risk and ensuring compliance (GDPR Art. 5(1)(c), CCPA §1798.100).

**Implementation:** Configure MongoDB schemas to enforce minimal data fields and audit stored data periodically.
