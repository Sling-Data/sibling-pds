## Project Overview
Sibling is a user-centric Personal Data Store (PDS) that collects, manages, and harnesses an individual’s comprehensive data profile—integrating volunteered, behavioral, and external data. It empowers users to train AI assistants (e.g., Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini) for personalized support, prioritizing user autonomy, transparency, and security.

### Mission
Enable individuals to own their data, refine it, and unlock tailored AI assistance.

### Vision
Make AI a trusted, personalized partner via a user-controlled data foundation.
